# WIP, More detailed instructions will be written eventually, when this project is actually working
How to Install on a coprocessor:

Step 1: Install Python 3.13 on your coprocessor

Step 2: Clone this git repo onto your coprocessor

Step 3: Create python virtual environment (optional)

Step 4: Install requirements.txt

>As of now there is not a way to automatically start SamuraiVision when the coprocessor boots, you need to manually ssh into the coprocessor and launch SamuraiVision. Eventually I'll write a shell script or something to automatically launch SamuraiVision on startup.
>As a reminder, SamuraiVision is under active development, these instructions are only for testing
>To get SamuraiVision working in WSL, you may need to recompile the WSL kernel. A guide can be found here: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1405903/capturing-webcam-video-with-opencv-in-wsl2
