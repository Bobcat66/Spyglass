How to Install on linux:

Step 1: Clone this repository (NOTE: DO NOT CLONE INTO /opt/, the installation script copies code into a new directory in /opt/, if it detects that /opt/Spyglass/ already exists, it will not complete the installation)

Step 2: Set this repo's root folder (Spyglass) as your working directory, and run the following command:
`sudo bash install.sh`
