How to Install on linux:

Step 1: Ensure the `ip` command is installed on your system

Step 2: Ensure python 3 is installed, as well as python3-venv

Step 3: Clone this repository (NOTE: DO NOT CLONE INTO /opt/, the installation script copies code into a new directory in /opt/, if it detects that /opt/SamuraiSight/ already exists, it will not complete the installation)

Step 4: Set this repo's root folder (SamuraiSight) as your working directory, and run the following command:
`sudo bash install.sh` (NOTE: THE INSTALLER IS DESIGNED TO RUN IN A BASH SHELL! IT WILL NOT WORK WITH ZSH!!!)

Step 5: Follow the instructions in the installation script
